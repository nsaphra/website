*I dream that my thumbs fall off, sliding to the ground. I dream that every bone in my hands breaks, leaving them a quivering gelatinous mass. I dream that my arms break out in open sores, bleeding and oozing pus. I wake up and the pain has sunk back beneath my unbroken skin -- invisible, intolerable.*

In August of 2015, my hands stopped working. I could still control them, but every movement accumulated more pain, so every motion came with a cost: getting dressed in the  morning, sending a text, lifting a glass. In relating this story, I often mention that I spent a month with nothing to do but go to a bar and order a shot of vodka with a straw in it. I then laugh, as though this is a joke. For the first month, I couldn't uncurl my fingers.

I often allow people to assume, for their own comfort, that I experience less pain now. This is not true. Every time I have told this story, I've been ignoring the background buzz of tingling, burning pain. The pain has not stopped for four years. When I share this information, people don't know how to respond, which is why I let the story end as though the pain is in the past.

Now that the formalities are out of the way, we can move to my main goal: a guide to my setup and the technologies and strategies that enable me to be productive without typing or writing.

The star of the show is Talon, a system which makes it easy to write customized grammars and scripts that work with speech recognition systems to enable programmers.

# Biography

I am a PhD student at The University of Edinburgh, studying NLP and machine learning with my primary supervisor [Adam Lopez](https://alopez.github.io/). My current interests relate to NLP learning dynamics: how deep models learn to encode linguistic structure, and how we can encode inductive bias from linguistics into the training process. In my spare time, I play roller derby under the name [Gaussian Retribution](https://auldreekierollerderby.com/2019/08/10/the-one-gift-i-received-along-with-my-disability/), do [standup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzNDdS-lcqM), and shepherd disabled programmers into the world of [code dictation](http://nsaphra.github.io/post/hands/).
